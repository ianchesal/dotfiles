This guy was using LazyVim before going to LunarVim and I've found his
configurations very helpful as a reference for how to tweak stuff. The LazyVim
docs don't make it super obvious how to you take a plugin it installs by default
and modify it just a bit but this guy's configurations make it super obvious.

In particular, I found his mason and lsp configuration stuff super helpful in
getting my setup super clean, working and error free.

Another example set of configs is here:
https://codeberg.org/jcowgar/nvim-lazyvim -- it's a little more involved when
overriding default plugins LazyVim uses, but still a good reference.
