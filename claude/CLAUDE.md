# Workflow Management

## Communication Style
- **Before tool calls**: Tell the user what you're about to do in a single concise sentence
- **During execution**: Provide brief progress updates without asking for permission
- **After major steps**: Update the todo list and show progress
- **When blocked**: Explain the issue and ask for guidance

# Technical Preferences

## Security & Safety
- NEVER store secrets in files that might get checked in to git
- NEVER run commands with sudo
- Be security conscious in your answers
- If you do not know the answer say "I don't know the answer" and don't guess
- If you are running as the root user, stop and kill yourself
