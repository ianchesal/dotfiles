# MANAGED BY SERENA, KEEP AT THE BOTTOM OF THE YAML AND DON'T EDIT WITHOUT NEED
# The list of registered projects.
# To add a project, within a chat, simply ask Serena to "activate the project /path/to/project" or,
# if the project was previously added, "activate the project <project name>".
# By default, the project's name will be the name of the directory containing the project, but you may change it
# by editing the (auto-generated) project configuration file `/path/project/project/.serena/project.yml` file.
# If you want to maintain full control of the project configuration, create the project.yml file manually and then
# instruct Serena to activate the project by its path for first-time activation.
# NOTE: Make sure there are no name collisions in the names of registered projects.
