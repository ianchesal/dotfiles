# dotfiles

My dotfiles. What else were you expecting?

## Use

    git clone --recursive git@github.com:ianchesal/dotfiles.git

Linking up dotfiles is currently a manual process. Maybe I'll automate it some day. It's not arduous enough to require automation right now.

Most of this stuff assumes you've cloned this repository to `~/code/dotfiles` in your environment.
