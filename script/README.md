# Coder/Codespaces Bootstrapping

This directory holds the things that let me bootstrap my dotfiles in to a
[Coder](https://coder.com) workspace. It follows the conventions set forth in
the [Codespaces
Dotfiles](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/setting-your-user-preferences/personalizing-github-codespaces-for-your-account#dotfiles)
support so use the Github docs to understand what's happening here.
